<a name="intro"></a>
## 1. Description

I created a machine learning model and web backend to identify social media trends (specifically on Instagram). <br> <br>
I have found a lot of success with this model and application, successfully growing my account to 161K+ followers.
Upload a set of images (more than 1), and the Python backend will display what image is predicted to work the best as a social media post. <br>

## 2. Technologies Used

I used Python, Tensorflow, Keras (ML), Flask, HTML/CSS (Web).

cd Expredict
python3 module.py
```

Navigate to http://localhost:5000 using your favorite browser!

## 4. Future improvements
1. Improve the accuracy of the ML model by trying different types of regressions and modeling.

2. Currently, the model requires human intelligence to identify certain niches on a certain account before scraping. We can create another model that categorizes these niches and skips the human intelligence step.
